Because we have such a wide selection<br />
of fun stuff at Homeport and only a percentage<br />
represented on our web site you will want to<br />
come by the store so that you can add a full range<br />
of items for your guests to choose from.<br /><br /> It's real easy to do.<br />
Now that you have created your registry<br />
all you need to do is give us a call<br />(802) 863-4832 to set up an appointment<br />
that way we can give you attention you deserve.<br /><br />
If you have any questions about the process<br />
don't hesitate to contact us at<br /><input value="email:home@homeportonline.com" onclick="parent.location='mailto:home@homeportonline.com'" type="button">
<br />or by phone (802) 863-4832</p>
